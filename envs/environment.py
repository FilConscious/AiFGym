Abstract environment base class for RL-Glue-py.

The BaseAgent class uses the RLGlue class. Those two classes were provided and used in the Reinforcement Learning Specialization created by 
Martha White and Adam White on Coursera in early 2020 (offered by the University of Alberta and Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute).
